            The introduction of the synthesizer revolutionized cinematic music by providing composers with a vast range of new sounds and textures that were previously impossible to achieve with traditional instruments. Synthesizers allowed for the creation of unique, futuristic, and otherworldly sounds, which became especially influential in science fiction and horror films. Their versatility and ability to manipulate sound led to a more experimental approach in film scoring, expanding the creative possibilities and enhancing the emotional impact of cinematic storytelling.
